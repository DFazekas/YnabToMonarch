            <p class="text-blue-700 text-sm">
              This application is a data transfer tool only and does not provide financial, investment, tax, legal, 
              or any other professional advice. You should consult with qualified professionals before making any

          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">2. Purpose and Data Use</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>We are completely transparent about how we use your data:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
            <li><strong>Primary Purpose:</strong> To transfer your transaction history, account information, and budget data from YNAB to Monarch Money as requested by you.</li>
            <li><strong>Secondary Purpose:</strong> To provide you with preview capabilities, account mapping tools, and migration status messaging to ensure accurate data transfer.</li>
            <li><strong>Token Management:</strong> We store YNAB-issued OAuth access and refresh tokens in secure HttpOnly cookies so we can make the YNAB API calls you request; these tokens are never shared with third parties and expire automatically (access tokens in ~1 hour, refresh tokens in up to 12 months).</li>
            <li><strong>No Other Uses:</strong> We do not use your data for analytics, marketing, advertising, or any other commercial purposes beyond the core functionality described above.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">3. Data Collection and Handling</h2>
          
          <h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">What Data We Access</h3>
          <p>Through the YNAB API, we access:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
            <li>Your budget information and categories</li>
            <li>Account names, types, and balances</li>
            <li>Transaction history including payees, amounts, dates, and memos</li>
            <li>Account-specific transaction counts and balances</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">How We Handle Your Data</h3>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
            <li><strong>Secure Processing:</strong> All data is processed securely using industry-standard encryption both in transit and at rest</li>
            <li><strong>Browser Processing:</strong> Budget, account, and transaction content stays in your browser memory/localStorage/sessionStorage and is never written to our databases because we do not operate any</li>
            <li><strong>Token Storage Only:</strong> The only data persisted outside your browser is the YNAB OAuth access/refresh tokens, which live in encrypted HttpOnly cookies on our Netlify functions solely so we can call the YNAB API on your behalf</li>
            <li><strong>Short-Lived Access Tokens:</strong> Access tokens automatically expire after approximately one hour; refresh tokens can be valid for up to one year but can be revoked at any time</li>
            <li><strong>Browser-Based Session:</strong> Session data is stored in your browser only and is automatically cleared when you complete the transfer, close the browser tab, or clear your browser data</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Access Tokens and Security</h3>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
            <li>We securely handle OAuth access tokens obtained directly from YNAB</li>
            <li>Access tokens are encrypted and stored only for the duration of your active session</li>
            <li>We never store your YNAB username, password, or any financial account credentials</li>
            <li>All API communications use HTTPS encryption</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">4. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>We guarantee that your data will not unknowingly be passed to any third party.</strong>
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
            <li><strong>No Data Sales:</strong> We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal or financial data to any third parties</li>
            <li><strong>No Analytics Sharing:</strong> We do not share your data with analytics services, advertising networks, or data brokers</li>
            <li><strong>Intended Transfer Only:</strong> The only "sharing" of your data is the intended transfer to Monarch Money, which you explicitly authorize and initiate</li>
            <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may use trusted service providers (like hosting services) who are bound by strict confidentiality agreements and only process data as necessary to provide our service</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">5. Data Storage and Management</h2>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
            <li><strong>Browser Storage:</strong> Budget, account, and transaction payloads are stored exclusively in your browser's localStorage/sessionStorage and are never uploaded to our servers</li>
            <li><strong>Session Data:</strong> Temporary transfer data is stored in browser sessionStorage and automatically cleared when you close the browser tab</li>
            <li><strong>Token Cookies:</strong> YNAB OAuth tokens are stored as HttpOnly Secure cookies managed by our Netlify functions; access tokens expire within one hour and refresh tokens within twelve months unless you revoke them earlier, and the in-app "Log Out" control immediately calls our revoke endpoint to clear both cookies</li>
            <li><strong>Retention Duration:</strong> Outside of those short-lived cookies, YNAB-derived budget data exists only during your active session and is purged when the transfer completes or when you close the tab</li>
            <li><strong>User Control:</strong> You have complete control over browser-stored data and can clear it anytime by clearing your browser data or using developer tools</li>
            <li><strong>Deletion Support:</strong> Use the in-app "Log Out" button to clear cookies instantly or email fazekas.devon@gmail.com to request manual token revocation, cookie invalidation, or written confirmation that all YNAB-derived data has been purged</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">6. Your Rights and Controls</h2>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
            <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can request information about what data processing occurs in your browser and what tokens we currently store</li>
            <li><strong>Local Control:</strong> You have complete control over browser storage via your own device settings</li>
            <li><strong>Revocation:</strong> Revoke OAuth access directly from your YNAB account or contact us to revoke tokens and invalidate refresh cookies immediately</li>
            <li><strong>Data Portability:</strong> Since we don't store your budget data, everything remains in your YNAB account unless you export it</li>
            <li><strong>Deletion Requests:</strong> Trigger the built-in "Log Out" action at any time to erase stored tokens, or email fazekas.devon@gmail.com for manual confirmation and revocation</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">7. Security Measures</h2>
